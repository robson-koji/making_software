This is a very straight to the point install guide for the making_software.

1. Virtualenv
It is not mandatory, but recommended. Not only because it is a good practice, but it turns easy the install process.
Go anywhere in you filesystem and type mkvirtualenv making_software
And after your virtual environment has been created type workon making_software

2. Git
You have to have Git installed on your computer to get the code.  
git clone https://github.com/fortinbras/making_software.git

3. Install the Django layer of the making_software
After download the code from Git, go to the making_software folder and execute ./install.sh.
This step will execute some tasks:
Install requirements.txt
Edit settings.py

3.a - Load database
Go to making_software/loopware folder and type ./manage.py syncdb.

3.b - Run Djangoâ€™s http server
If all runs as expected, making_software has been installed. Run the server typing ./manage.py runserver
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8000


4. Install the Perl layer of the making_software
You have to install Perl layer with sudo or root user, depending on your Linux distribution.
Run ./install_perl_layer.sh


5. Create and deploy systems.
If everything went fine you can create some systems. Open your browser, and point to localhost:8000
Deploy your created systems by typing ./create_project.pl <id of project> <making_software_home_dir>
You can access your created system on your brower at localhost port 8001. If port 8001 is being used, kill the processo listening on that port and run create_project.pl again.


Obs:
1. You should install PIL or PILLOW in order to run making_software, since it has an image upload field. 
	Installing this componentes varies a lot from different Linux distributions because many image libs are required.
	Check your SO for informations.

2. For Centos 6 users - You need to install CPAN before run install_perl_layer.sh. Just run the command 'yum install cpan'

3. You must run first install.sh and after install_perl_layer.sh, because the first one configures some data for the second one.
